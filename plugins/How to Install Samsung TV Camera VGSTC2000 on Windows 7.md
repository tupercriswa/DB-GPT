Many users have praised the Samsung TV Camera VG-STC2000 for its high-quality video and audio, easy setup, and compatibility with various apps. One user wrote on Amazon [^1^]: "Now I have this camera, the TV is hardwired into the cable box and works first time, every time. Setup is incredibly easy (just dont forget to open the lens cover first!) Its great being able to sit on the sofa and have a conversation with my whole family (and cats) in shot."
 
However, some users have also reported some drawbacks of the Samsung TV Camera VG-STC2000, such as its high price, limited availability, and lack of support for newer Samsung TVs. Some users also complained about the camera not working well in low-light conditions or with certain apps. Therefore, before buying this camera, you should check if it is compatible with your Samsung TV model and your preferred video chat app.
  
If you are looking for an alternative to the Samsung TV Camera VG-STC2000, you may have a hard time finding one that works with your Samsung Smart TV. According to some sources [^2^] [^3^], the VG-STC family of cameras were custom-designed for Samsung TVs only, and there is no official driver for Windows or Linux. You may be able to find some unofficial drivers online, but they may not work well or at all.
 
Some users have suggested using a regular webcam with a USB extension cable and plugging it into the USB port of the Samsung TV [^4^]. However, this may not work with all models of Samsung TVs or webcams, and you may need to adjust some settings on your TV or webcam. You should also check the compatibility of your webcam with your preferred video chat app.
 
Another option is to use a smartphone or tablet as a webcam and connect it to your Samsung TV via Wi-Fi or HDMI cable. You can use apps like DroidCam, iVCam, or EpocCam to turn your mobile device into a webcam and stream video to your TV. You may need to install some software on your PC or TV to make this work. You should also make sure that your mobile device has a good camera and microphone, and that your Wi-Fi connection is stable.
